# SQL Database Interaction
 This project involves interacting with SQLite databases using Python. It includes creating and populating a database, performing basic and JOIN queries, and analyzing data from the provided databases. The project emphasizes SQL query execution and data retrieval using the sqlite3 module.

Introduction
Welcome to the SQL Database Interaction project! This project focuses on utilizing Python to interact with SQLite databases. You will write code to create, populate, and query databases, analyzing data from both a custom database and the Northwind sample database.

Part 1 - Making and Populating a Database
The first part involves creating a new SQLite database file, defining a table, and inserting data into the table. Ensure that you follow the instructions provided in the project description to successfully complete this part.

Part 2 - The Northwind Database - Basic Queries
In this part, you will connect to the Northwind sample database and perform basic queries. Follow the instructions provided to answer specific questions and save the queries accordingly.

Part 3 - Sailing the Northwind Seas (JOIN statements)
Part 3 builds upon the previous part by incorporating JOIN statements to retrieve more complex data from the Northwind database. Follow the instructions provided to answer the given questions using JOIN operations.

File Structure
demo_data.py: Contains code for creating and populating a custom SQLite database, along with queries to analyze the data.
northwind.py: Includes code for connecting to the Northwind sample database and performing basic and JOIN queries.
demo_data.sqlite3: The SQLite database file generated by executing demo_data.py.
northwind_small.sqlite3: The Northwind sample database provided for performing queries.
Running the Code
Ensure that you have Python installed on your system along with the required modules (sqlite3). To run the code, execute the Python scripts (demo_data.py and northwind.py) in your preferred Python environment.

Submission
Submit the following files to CodeGrade:

demo_data.py
northwind.py
demo_data.sqlite3
northwind_small.sqlite3
Note
For parts 2 and 3, save the query strings directly to the indicated variable names (expensive_items, avg_hire_age, ten_most_expensive, largest_category). Include the output from your queries as docstring comments to facilitate grading and feedback.
